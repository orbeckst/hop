setup(name="Hop",
      version="0.3.0",
      description="Hop analyses solvent dynamics in molecular dynamics trajectories",
      long_description="""\
Hop performs a 'hopping analysis' of molecules in molecular dynamics
(MD) trajectories. Typically, these molecules are water molecules. The
movement of all waters is tracked as they move between hydration
sites. Hydration sites are interpreted as vertices in a graph, while
movement (or 'hops') between them are taken as edges. In this way
hydration is characterized at a coarse grained level as a network of
hops with rate constants and fluxes derived from the MD simulations.\
